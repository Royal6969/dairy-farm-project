 🎨 For some UI components styles, I will use Bunifu Framework
  - It requires a paid license, but we can crack it...

  I also installed Guna UI2 Framework, for other styles, and you can get it here (free trial)

 📝 Basic structure to start
 We start with a form template that we rename to Splash.cs (preload screen),
 and after that, we create the Login.cs (login screen) adding a new class element (type Windows Forms)
 
 Tip: To see changes faster, change in Program.cs Application.Run(new Splash()) to Application.Run(new "component"()).
